"In a context of unprecedented cross-cultural migration, immigrants struggle to adapt to new cultures. The experience of home as physical, social, individual and temporal belonging is important to immigrants' adaptation processes. Extant literature either focuses on dimensions of home without reference to immigrants, studies material culture related to home, or researches identity projects of migrants without explicitly focusing on their subjective experience of home. This study adopts a phenomenological perspective to gain an in-depth understanding of first generation immigrants' subjective transcultural experiencing of home. By means of autobiographical phenomenological interviews the study identifies three ways of experiencing home: Longing for the past; transcultural mingling of social relationships and consumption; and experiencing home within oneself. The study corroborates extant literature on home, material culture and consumer acculturation and complements this literature with an additional, inner-directed focus of experiencing home. The findings have important implications for corporate and public policy makers.",Journal of Business Research,2018,Maria Kreuzer and Hans Mühlbacher and Sylvia {von Wallpach},334-341,,Home in the re-making: Immigrants' transcultural experiencing of home,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.10.047,91,,KREUZER2018334,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296317304290,0148-2963,article,"Home, Immigration, Transcultural experience, Consumption"
"This paper uses the perspective of interpersonal relationship theory to critically examine, reposition, and extend the notion of brand loyalty. Depth interviews among eight coffee-consuming adults who qualified as brand loyal by traditional criteria provide the data. The result is a deeper appreciation of the character of loyal consumer-brand relations and a sharper awareness of the limitations to understanding that current theoretical frameworks impose. Specifically, the authors suggest that: (1) not all loyal brand relationships are alike, in strength or in character; (2) many brand relationships not identified as ‘loyal’ according to dominant theoretical conceptions are especially meaningful from the cunsumer's point of view; and (3) current approaches to classification accept some brand relationships that, upon close scrutiny, do not possess assumed characteristics of ‘loyalty’ or ‘strength’ at all. Ideas stemming from a reframing of loyalty as one component in a multifaceted construct of relationship strength are put forth, encouraging a move from the metaphor of ‘loyalty’ to the broader notion of ‘relationships’ that encompasses it.",International Journal of Research in Marketing,1997,Susan Fournier and Julie L.

"One criticism of the tourism area lifecycle model is that it treats destinations as homogeneous entities. Instead destinations can be conceptualised as a mosaic of elements, each of which can follow a lifecycle that is different from that of the destination overall. This paper examines this issue with reference to amusement arcades in British seaside resorts and triangulates secondary sources and in-depth interviews to examine the historical evolution of this sector. It argues that the arcade sector has followed a lifecycle trajectory that is independent of the resorts in which they are located. A range of internal/external factors and global, national and local influences have affected the lifecycle of the arcade sector, including global developments in the entertainment industries; the influence of state policies and legislation; and the responses of local entrepreneurs to resort restructuring. The paper ends by arguing that destinations can be conceptualised as 'assemblages' of interacting elements.",Tourism Management,2016,Anya Chapman and Duncan Light,254-263,,Exploring the tourist destination as a mosaic: The alternative lifecycles of the seaside amusement arcade sector in Britain,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2015.06.020,52,,CHAPMAN2016254,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517715001442,0261-5177,article,"TALC model, Seaside resorts, Global-local interactions"
"Tranquility seeking is growing phenomenon in tourism. While tranquility has been frequently used in tourism motivation literature, it is unclear what it means in tourism and how to recognize it in tourism motivation. The study seeks to explore the forms of tranquility through a lens of motivational framework. Data collecting from Moganshan town, a well-known rural resort in China, revealed that vacationers acknowledged various forms of tranquility in holiday experiences in general. Specifically, the need of tranquil amenities rather than need of tranquil states was dominant trigger of the phenomenon; affective qualities of tranquility were the main source of information that influenced the destination choice. The inclusion of tranquility in tourism extends our understanding of tourism motivation and adds a new subject applicable to tourism.",Tourism Management,2019,Jing Han,299-310,,Vacationers in the countryside: Traveling for tranquility?,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2018.09.001,70,,HAN2019299,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517718302097,0261-5177,article,"Tranquility, Tourist motivation, Tourist need, Destination attribute, Rural tourism, Vacationers, Niche tourism"
"The controversy over postmodernism is often focused on the impact of consumer culture upon language. In this article, the historical relationship between commerce, language, and communication technology is explored. The struggle between mass and elite over the forms of literacy is outlined, raising questions about the sources of critical hostility toward postmodern culture. The author offers an alternative viewpoint, in which postmodern expression integrates words, pictures, and sound in a manner that is multidimensional, accessible, and communal.",International Journal of Research in Marketing,1993,Linda M.

"While there is extensive literature on the positive impact of salesperson brand identification, we have little understanding about its negative effects in the luxury context where brand aura can generate deviant behavior. To investigate the negative consequences of salesperson brand identification in the luxury sector, we conducted qualitative studies, including observations and interviews with retail managers, salespeople and consumers. On the one hand and according to managers, salespeople with brand identification present high resistance to change and generate brand distortion. On the other hand, salespeople with brand identification, in particular those with low self-confidence or low brand seniority, develop a selling approach with strong brand centricity but little customer orientation. Regarding consumers, salespeople with brand identification may generate negative perceptions, particularly for those customers with brand and product expertise and those engaging in exclusive brand relationships.",Journal of Business Research,2019,Michaela Merk and Géraldine Michel,339-352,,The dark side of salesperson brand identification in the luxury sector: When brand orientation generates management issues and negative customer perception,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.01.037,102,,MERK2019339,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296319300608,0148-2963,article,"Salespeople, Luxury retail, Brand identification, Brand orientation, Salesforce management, Luxury consumption"
"Using Hiroshima and Nagasaki as case studies, this paper explores the extent to which sites of atomic bomb explosions have been memorialized and embedded in tourism promotion for educational purposes. Findings from interviews with government officers and discourse analysis of tourism brochures highlight the complexity of using former atomic bomb sites in the context of contemporary Japan. These findings reveal four themes aligned in two pairs: tourism–education and war–peace. These themes are intertwined with the historical context of the two cities. As a tourist destination, conservative Hiroshima centers on the remembrance of the atomic tragedy and the traditional or nostalgic aspects of Japanese culture, whereas relatively liberal Nagasaki presents itself as a melting pot of cultures. Both cities retain their central role of publicly commemorating the victims of the atomic bomb for the Japanese.",Journal of Destination Marketing & Management,2016,Kaori Yoshida and Huong T.

"This paper aims to extend understanding of the way Chinese domestic tourists and local communities understand and use the World Heritage Ancient Villages of Xidi and Hongcun. Tourism in each of these villages is managed differently, with the tourism companies respectively managed by a local collective and by an external operator. The paper argues that understanding the emotional engagement of tourists interacting not only with the heritage sites but also with residents allows a deeper understanding of the social impacts of tourism. Moreover, it reveals how historical and heritage meaning may be reinforced or remade through individual and collective tourism practices, and the consequences of local inclusion or exclusion in tourism management. Understanding the affective and emotional content of the cultural and social interactions of tourists and residents at these sites illustrates the agency of both tourists and residents in the making and remaking of heritage values and meaning.",Tourism Management,2019,Rouran Zhang and Laurajane Smith,212-223,,Bonding and dissonance: Rethinking the Interrelations Among Stakeholders in Heritage Tourism,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2019.03.004,74,,ZHANG2019212,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517719300536,0261-5177,article,"Heritage tourism, China, Emotion, Agency, Authorized heritage discourse, Local engagement"
"This research develops a theoretical model that provides new insight into excessive consumption and identification based on the consumption of rugby and brand biography of the All Blacks. This paper is grounded in Maori protocols and the spiritual relationship between the All Blacks, New Zealand and Maori. The conceptual model development process is based on the grounded theory approach and analysis of interview evidence from 15 fans in New Zealand. The model posits that the cultural sources of excessive identification or importance in consumption relate to country factors. In terms of response, excessive fan identification has two major outcomes at the individual level, one positive and the other negative. From a negative standpoint, excessive behavior leads to deviant behaviors, such as violence, misplaced priorities, psychological flow and rationalization. From a positive standpoint, however, excessive identification leads to more benign consumption in the form of cultural and social capital and communitas. Future research implications are discussed.",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,2016,Robert Davis and Lee Phillip McGinnis,252-262,,Conceptualizing excessive fan consumption behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2015.10.002,28,,DAVIS2016252,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698915300850,0969-6989,article,"Fan behavior, Consumption, Excessive, Rationalization, Maori, All Blacks, Conceptual model, Grounded theory"
"This paper identifies and discusses the variety of approaches we use to explain the events and acts which comprise the socio-organizational phenomena we strive to understand. In the past few years a number of thoughtful discussions have been published on the differences and similarities of the various methods of explanation. The discussion has been stimulated in part by the limitations of traditional causal determinism, (as used in the physical sciences) for explaining phenomena encountered in both the biological and social sciences. By and large, however, little attempt has been made to create typologies of the different explanatory approaches. Notable exceptions are Aristotle (4 types of causes), MacIver (6 types of causation) and Bunge (causal, semi-causal and a-causal determinism). From discussions of three different approaches, namely causal, teleological and gestaltic explanations, (together with their derivatives and their hybrids), a typology is presented. The basis of the typology is the temporal relationship between the events to be explained (the explicandum) and the events which are employed as part of the explanation (the explicans events). The purpose of the article is to draw attention to the almost paradoxical contrast between the future-oriented nature of what practicing managers actually do, and the past-oriented nature of most of our scientific theories. It is suggested that past-oriented explanations may be intrinsically incapable of producing viable theories of social/organizational change.",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,1976,Roger D.

"This paper builds on Belk's notions of the extended, social, family and dialogic selves in an attempt to explore the transformation of the self during the Arab Spring phenomena. From the perspective of the respondents in Egypt and Libya, this paper provides a reading of how images of self are related to artifacts of consumption, rituals, and symbols and how consumer values are navigated through this difficult landscape. The paper uses a three phase history, happening, and hopes narratives to show that the self in a liminal period of flux is referent to history and hopes and proposes a notion of a transitional self that incorporates this observation of reference to past and future. In particular, the findings suggest that consumption, especially Western consumption can be transcendental during a liminal period of flux and that such revelatory incidents offer an opportunity to access the candid thoughts of consumers.",Journal of Business Research,2016,Ahmed Al-Abdin and Dianne Dean and John D.

"This paper briefly reviews literature relating to festivals, and then reports findings from a sample attending two festivals in Saskatchewan, Canada. A jazz and a handcrafts festival were studied as being representative of ‘cultural product’ festivals. Quality of programme emerged as the most important factor for tourists, but contextual elements including accessibility and programme arrangements were also important. For the majority of festival-goers, other recreational and cultural facilities were unimportant.",Tourism Management,1993,Farouk Saleh and Chris Ryan,289-297,4,Jazz and knitwear: Factors that attract tourists to festivals,https://doi.org/10.1016/0261-5177(93)90063-Q,14,,SALEH1993289,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/026151779390063Q,0261-5177,article,
"Urban tourism is a relatively recent phenomenon but is now being embraced by most US cities, which are using substantial funds to compete for visitors, creating elaborate new infrastructures in the process. This article provides an analytical overview of the steps a variety of US cities are taking — such as developing a new brand image, refurbishing run-down areas, touting for conference business, building shopping malls and creating ‘carousal’ zones — to promote tourism. The author also examines how far these strategies translate into economic and social success.",Tourism Management,1995,Dennis R Judd,175-187,3,Promoting tourism in US cities,https://doi.org/10.1016/0261-5177(94)00018-6,16,,JUDD1995175,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0261517794000186,0261-5177,article,"cities, image, infrastructure"
"This study identifies implications of dark tourism and describes how tourists and destinations, which are principal collateral cores, define what constitutes “dark” travel. The study also examines the dimensions of dark tourism motivation and experience and finds that the former partly affects the latter. The exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis aimed to examine why tourists approach and engage with disaster sites and how such experiences may affect tourists motivation and emotional reaction. It is the first paper that applies structural equation modelling to dark tourism research. We focus on the causal relationships between dimensions of motivation and experience, and the relationship that the emotional reactions effect on tourist experiences. We find that the curious visitors are likely to engage cognitively by learning about the incident or related issues and tourists' emotional reaction to the “dark” space influence more heavily emotional tourist experiences than cognitive experiences do.",Tourism Management,2016,Bing-Jin Yan and Jie Zhang and Hong-Lei Zhang and Shao-Jing Lu and Yong-Rui Guo,108-121,,"Investigating the motivation–experience relationship in a dark tourism space: A case study of the Beichuan earthquake relics, China",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2015.09.014,53,,YAN2016108,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517715300145,0261-5177,article,"Dark tourism, Disaster tourism, Experience, Motivation, Emotional reaction"
"The canons of good praxis in the social sciences are changing. Along with the linguistic and hermeneutic (interpretive) challenges to ontology and epistemology exerted by continental philosophers and social theorists in the 20th century, have come dynamic changes in travel and tourism. We start this paper by tracing five important dynamisms in the phenomenology and constructive power of tourism and travel. These five encompass tourism as an agent of seeing, an agent of being, an agent of experience, an agent of cultural invention and an agent of knowing. But are tourism studies equipped with the research tools, approaches, strategies and techniques to explore the proliferation of new communal orders, marginalized voices in the third spaces in-between cultures and spaces, the overstimulation and fluid images cast by media, technology and urban intrusions, and the rapidly changing margins of tourist–host encounters in performative sites? The paper goes on to outline some of the twists and turns that qualitative research has undergone in its attempts to shake itself free of the inheritances of positivism and scientism. The confusion in the meaning of `interpretive research’ is one of the several challenges that are discussed and related to qualitative inquiry in tourism studies. The loss of the `body’ in tourism is another such issue. While foundationalist assumptions of truth, objectivity, and validity are being slowly relinquished, how are qualitative researchers to deal with the new textualities, multi-vocalities and `situated knowledges’ of participant voices and experiences in the ambigious and uncertain interstices of human–societal/tourist–touree encounters? In relating the above issues of and about the so-called `forbidden zone’ of qualitative inquiry to tourism studies, we focus predominantly in this paper on the place and value of `messy texts', `engaged interestedness', `locality/local knowledges’ and the `confirmability’ of qualitative inquiry.",Tourism Management,2001,T Jamal and K Hollinshead,63-82,1,Tourism and the forbidden zone: the underserved power of qualitative inquiry,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0261-5177(00)00020-0,22,,JAMAL200163,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517700000200,0261-5177,article,"Qualitative inquiry, Tourism phenomenology, Anti-foundational research, `Interpretive’ research, Messy texts, Engaged interestedness, Locality/local knowledges, `Validity', Inter-disciplinary tourism studies"
"In the limited number of analyses undertaken on tourism development and post-socialist processes of restructuring in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), most attention has been paid to the more advanced societies of Central Europe. By contrast, Europe's less developed and relatively unstable south-eastern corner, where tourism development issues may take on a different complexion, has been relatively neglected. Within this context, tourism's role in post-socialist restructuring in Central and Eastern Europe is examined, reflecting on issues of mass tourism and niche segregation. Rural tourism is examined as a vehicle for sustainable development in South-eastern Europe, and some of the paradoxes facing issues of sustainability in tourism development are examined in relation to recent development processes. With a dynamic mix of mass and niche markets to target, the potential of rural tourism development in South-eastern Europe continues to be constrained by regional instability.",Tourism Management,1998,Derek R Hall,423-431,5,Tourism development and sustainability issues in Central and South-Eastern Europe,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0261-5177(98)00039-9,19,,HALL1998423,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517798000399,0261-5177,article,"Central and Eastern Europe, South-eastern Europe, rural tourism, sustainable development"

"Hong Kong is a city where contemporary global culture coexists with traditional Chinese heritage. One way of promoting Hong Kong's traditional built heritage is to develop a number of linked sites as a heritage trail. For helping the development of such, this study evaluates the applicability of the market appeal—robusticity matrix on heritage tourism development, by assessing the potential for tourism in the single-surname villages of Hong Kong's New Territories. The study techniques include documentary research, questionnaire survey and interviews. The findings indicate the matrix is effective for enabling the assessment of heritage tourism potential because it simultaneously demonstrates the importance of two major considerations for both tourism industry and heritage managers, namely market appeal—an asset's appeal to tourists, and robusticity—its ability to endure visitation. The shortcomings of the model includes the inappropriateness of the technical term “product design needs” in the market appeal subset and lack of community concerns in the robusticity subset of the matrix.",Tourism Management,2004,Yiping Li and Raymond Lap Bong Lo,789-800,6,Applicability of the market appeal—robusticity matrix: a case study of heritage tourism,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2004.06.006,25,,LI2004789,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517704001323,0261-5177,article,"Heritage tourism, Hong Kong, Kam Tin, Market appeal, Robusticity"
"There are many types of tourism promotion and many more potential sources of tourist attractions, but in the category of ‘hallmark events’ one type of attraction and promotion has been largely ignored. This paper states the case of motion picture films' ‘pulling’ potential of the US tourist. Along with the notion of US tourists travelling to movie sites within the USA the paper suggests that the movie ‘Crocodile Dundee’ increased awareness of Australia's attractions in the minds of potential travellers. Reasons for attraction potential appear to lie within the motivations of escape, pilgrimage and a quest for untainted environments. These motivations are illuminated for the viewing public through movie storylines offering extended periods of vicarious contact with the destination and its attraction features.",Tourism Management,1992,Roger W.
